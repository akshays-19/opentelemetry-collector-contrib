  # The following example demonstrates inserting keys/values into spans.
  attributes/insert:
    actions:
      # The following inserts a new attribute {"attribute1": 123} to spans where
      # the key "attribute1" doesn't exist.
      # The type of `attribute1` is inferred by the configuration.
      #  `123` is an integer and is stored as an integer in the attributes.
      # This demonstrates how to backfill spans with an attribute that may
      # not have been sent by all clients.
      - key: "attribute1"
        value: 123
        action: insert
      # The following uses the value from attribute "anotherkey" to insert a new
      # attribute {"string key": <value from attribute "anotherkey">} to spans
      # where the key "string key" does not exist. If the attribute "anotherkey"
      # doesn't exist, no new attribute is inserted to spans.
      - key: "string key"
        from_attribute: "anotherkey"
        action: insert

  # The following demonstrates configuring the processor to only update existing
  # keys in an attribute.
  # Note: `action: update` must be set.
  attributes/update:
    actions:
      # The following updates the attribute 'boo' using the value from attribute
      # 'foo'. Spans without the attribute 'boo' will not change.
      - key: "boo"
        from_attribute: "foo"
        action: update
      # The following updates the attribute to { "db.secret": "redacted"}.
      # This demonstrates sanitizing spans of sensitive data.
      - key: db.secret
        value: redacted
        action: update

  # The following demonstrates setting an attribute on both spans where the
  # key does exist and the key doesn't exist.
  attributes/upsert:
    actions:
      # The following demonstrates how to set an attribute on all spans.
      # Any spans that already had `region` now have value `planet-earth`.
      # This can be done to set properties for all traces without
      # requiring an instrumentation change.
      - key: region
        value: "planet-earth"
        action: upsert

      # The following demonstrates copying a value to a new key.
      # Note: If a span doesn't contain `user_key`, no new attribute `new_user_key`
      # is created.
      - key: new_user_key
        from_attribute: user_key
        action: upsert

  # The following demonstrates deleting keys from an attribute.
  attributes/delete:
    actions:
      - key: credit_card
        action: delete
      - key: duplicate_key
        action: delete

  # The following demonstrates how to backfill spans missing an attribute,
  # insert/update that value to a new key and deleting the old key. This guarantees
  # an attribute `svc.operation` exists in spans and the attribute `operation`
  # doesn't exist.
  # Ex: The spans before the processor `attributes/complex`.
  # Span1 Attributes: {timeout: 10, svc.operation: addition, operation: addition}
  # Span2 Attributes: {operation: subtract, math_value: 123}
  # Span3 Attributes: {timeout: 10, math_value: 4}
  # Span4 Attributes: {svc.operation: division, timeout: 3}
  attributes/complex:
    actions:

        value: default
        action: insert
      # The spans after the first action of insert.
      # Span1 Attributes: {timeout: 10, svc.operation: addition, operation: addition}
      # Span2 Attributes: {operation: subtract, math_value: 123}
      # Span3 Attributes: {timeout: 10, math_value: 4, operation: default}
      # Span4 Attributes: {svc.operation: division, timeout: 3, operation:default}

      - key: svc.operation
        from_attribute: operation
        action: upsert
      # The spans after the second action of upsert.
      # Span1 Attributes: {timeout: 10, svc.operation: addition, operation: addition}
      # Span2 Attributes: {svc.operation: subtract, operation: subtract, math_value: 123}
      # Span3 Attributes: {svc.operation: default, timeout: 10, math_value: 4, operation: default}
      # Span4 Attributes: {svc.operation: default, timeout: 3, operation:default}

      - key: operation
        action: delete
      # The spans after the third/final action of delete.
      # Span1 Attributes: {timeout: 10, svc.operation: addition}
      # Span2 Attributes: {svc.operation: subtract, math_value: 123}
      # Span3 Attributes: {svc.operation: default, timeout: 10, math_value: 4}
      # Span4 Attributes: {svc.operation: default, timeout: 3}

  # The following is an example of various actions. The actions are applied in
  # the order specified in the configuration.
